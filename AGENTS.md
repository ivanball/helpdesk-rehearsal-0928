# Helpdesk (agent instructions)

Kept identical to CLAUDE.md, rule for rule. Tools that read AGENTS.md (Codex, GitHub Copilot
coding agent, Cursor, Gemini CLI) onboard from this file; Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md. One set
of rules, two file names, so every agent and every human starts from the same contract.

Modular monolith on .NET 10. Modules live under src/Modules/<Name> with four projects:
Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation. Composition root is Helpdesk.Host.

## Commands
- Build: dotnet build Helpdesk.slnx
- Test: dotnet test Helpdesk.slnx (API tests need the SQL container: docker compose up -d)
- Run: dotnet run --project src/Helpdesk.Host

## Layer rules (enforced by tests in Helpdesk.ArchitectureTests)
- Domain references only Helpdesk.SharedKernel. No NuGet packages in Domain.
- Application references Domain. Infrastructure and Presentation reference Application.
- Only Host references Infrastructure. Modules never reference other modules' internals.

## Conventions
- Errors: return Result / Result<T> from SharedKernel. Never throw for business rule
  failures. Exceptions are for bugs and infrastructure faults only.
- Entities: private constructors, static factory methods returning Result<T>.
- Handlers: one command or query per file, handler beside it, internal visibility.
- Nullable enabled, warnings as errors, file-scoped namespaces.
- Never: add a NuGet package without asking; touch the database schema without a migration.
- Ship: see docs/shipping.md (CI runs restore in locked mode; run dotnet restore --force-evaluate after changing a package)
- MCP: served at /mcp over streamable HTTP by the Host; stdio fallback: dotnet run --project src/Helpdesk.McpStdio
